# 6502 Simulator Desktop Edition

One of the best systems to start learning Assembly is with the old but amazing 8-bit Commodore 64. 
Thanks to Nick Morgan, creator of the [Easy 6502 and Easy 6502 tutorial with simulator](http://skilldrick.github.io/easy6502/), you can learn assembly very easily!

What would make it even easier is having your own Desktop 6502 Simulator to use. So to help make that happen
I went ahead and did exactly that. While I am not finished it is usable, and I plan to do whatever I can to 
make it a great desktop app in the near future.


## Usage

_At this time there are not any static builds (yet). You will find builds here in the future._

First things first, clone the repository! 

yarn install (or npm install)
npm start

## ToDo List

*Test on Windows/Linux
*Build Packages for all 3 Platforms
*Make the the application integration desktop-ish (hotkeys/menu items for assemble, *debug, and other options).
*Offer a Dark Theme
